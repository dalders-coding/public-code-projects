Hi there! My name is Derrick Alders and I'm an Engineer! 
I started school a little later but finished a double major degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering, and when I graduated, worked on rockets!
I decided I wanted to learn how to program and this repo will be where I keep all my little projects I do as I learn and show off the skill I develop. Someday, I'm wanting to release a video game that everyone can enjoy!
